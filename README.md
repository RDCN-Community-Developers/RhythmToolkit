# RhythmBase

#### \[ English | [中文](./README.zh-cn.md) \]

A high-performance, systematic, and intuitive level editing proxy development library for rhythm game developers, independent of any game engine.

Development progress is tracked [here](./TODO.md).

Examples can be found [here](/RhythmBase.Test/Tutorial.cs).

## Architecture Overview

```
RhythmBase                         ← Core library (NuGet package)
├── Global/                        ← Public interfaces, types, serialization infrastructure
│   ├── Components/                ← Color, EnumCollection, TickTime interface, Level interface...
│   ├── Events/                    ← IEvent, IDurationEvent, IFileEvent, IForwardEvent...
│   ├── Converters/                ← MetadataJsonConverter, MemberConverter, TypeConverterRegistry...
│   └── Extensions/                ← LINQ queries, event navigation...

RhythmBase.Generator              ← Source generator (Roslyn Incremental SourceGenerator)
└── Auto-generates: TickTime / TickTimeRange / Calculator / OrderedEventCollection / EventTypeRegistry / EventConverterMap / EnumConverterExtensions / event converters / ...

RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor            ← Rhythm Doctor adapter
RhythmBase.Adofai                  ← A Dance of Fire and Ice adapter
RhythmBase.BeatBlock               ← BeatBlock adapter
RhythmBase.Rizline                 ← Rizline adapter
```

**Serialization system**: The core library provides `MetadataJsonConverter<T>` (handles compound objects like Level, Settings, Row, etc.) and `MemberConverter<T>` (reads/writes event properties field by field). The source generator automatically produces converters and type-enum mappings for each event class based on declarations in `AssemblyInfo.cs`, eliminating the need to write serialization code by hand. See [Tutorial Part 2](docs/Tutorial.md#ii-implementing-a-new-level-type) for details.

**Supported level formats**:

| Game                  | Single file  | Multi-file directory                       | Archive         | JSON read/write    | Time parsing       | Version adaptation               |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Rhythm Doctor         | `.rdlevel`   | -                                          | `.rdzip` `.zip` | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:               |
| A Dance of Fire and Ice | `.adofai`  | -                                          | `.zip`          | :white_check_mark: |                    |                                  |
| BeatBlock             | -            | `manifest.json` + `level.json` + chart     | `.zip`          |                    |                    | :white_check_mark:(needs verify) |
| Rizline               | -            | `metadata.json` + chart                    | `.zip`          |                    |                    |                                  |

## Quick Start

```powershell
dotnet add package RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor
```

```cs
using RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor.Components;
using RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor.Events;

// Load level
using var level = Level.FromFile("level.rdlevel");

// Add event
level.Add(new Comment() { Text = "hello", Tab = Tab.Windows, Y = 2 });

// Save
level.SaveToFile("out.rdlevel");
```

## About This Project

This project was originally named `RhythmToolkit`, aiming to develop small tools to simplify level processing for Rhythm Doctor.\
As the project matured, its direction shifted toward becoming a foundational framework for other tools, and it expanded to support the A Dance of Fire and Ice (Adofai) level model.\
For this reason, the project was renamed `RhythmBase`, and tool-oriented content was migrated to other repositories. Of course, you can also call it `RDTK`!
