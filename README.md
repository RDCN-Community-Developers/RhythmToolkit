### Core Features

#### Comprehensive Event System Support

RhythmBase provides a strongly-typed event model for both Rhythm Doctor and A Dance of Fire and Ice, covering all official event types and Adofai's advanced filter system, also providing compatibility for potential new event models in the future. Through type checking and intelligent hints, it eliminates runtime errors at the source.

#### Intelligent Event Processing

- **Event Discovery and Querying** - Flexible LINQ query support makes it easy to filter events by type or condition
- **Automatic Relationship Management** - Event binding system automatically maintains parent-child relationships without manual tree structure handling
- **Timeline Generation** - Built-in timeline management tools support advanced temporal sequences and control logic

#### Rich Toolkit

- **RichText Support** - Complete rich text syntax parsing and code generation for dialogue and title events
- **Easing Function Library** - Contains all in-game easing curves with support for custom interpolation functions
- **RDCode Integration** - Native support for Rhythm Doctor's code system, including syntax analysis and expression evaluation
- **Macro Event System** - Generate complex event sequences through code while maintaining full compatibility with original levels

**🟩RhythmBase v1.3.4 .NET Standard 2.0**
- Uses `RDLeve.FromFile` to read the complete `rdzip` file and `RDLevel.SaveToFile` to save it as an `rdlevel` file.  
- Tested in .NET Framework 4.8.9221.0

**🟦RhythmBase v1.3.4 .NET 8.0**
- Uses `RDLeve.FromFile` to read the complete `rdzip` file and `RDLevel.SaveToFile` to save it as an `rdlevel` file.

### Platform and Language Interoperability

#### Cross-Platform Support

Thanks to .NET Standard 2.0 compatibility, RhythmBase runs seamlessly on multiple platforms:

- **Windows** - Via .NET Framework 4.6.1+ or .NET Core/8.0+
- **Linux** - Via .NET Core/8.0+ (with Mono compatibility)
- **macOS** - Via .NET Core/8.0+

This means regardless of your operating system, you get a consistent development experience and API interface, avoiding common cross-platform incompatibility issues.

#### Multi-Language Support

Thanks to cross-language interoperability technologies in the .NET ecosystem, you can call RhythmBase from different programming languages:

**C#, F#, VB.NET, C++/CLI** - Native support

**Python** - Via the [pythonnet](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet) library, you can use RhythmBase directly in Python, suitable for:
- Writing automation scripts
- Batch processing level files
- Integrating with Python data analysis tools

Here are concrete code examples:

**C# Example** - Standard .NET development approach:

```cs
using RhythmBase.Global.Components.Vector;
using RhythmBase.Global.Settings;
using RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor.Components;
using RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor.Events;

LevelReadOrWriteSettings settings = new()
{
	UnreadableEventsHandling = UnreadableEventHandling.Store,
};
RDLevel rdlevel = RDLevel.Default;

foreach (Row row in rdlevel.Rows)
{
	MoveRow moveRow = new MoveRow()
	{
		Beat = new RDBeat(3),
		Position = new RDPointE(10, 20),
	};
}

rdlevel.SaveToFile("111.rdlevel");
```

**Python Example** - Using pythonnet to bridge .NET and Python ecosystems:

```py
# Assembly loading operations
import pythonnet
pythonnet.load('coreclr')
import clr
clr.AddReference('RhythmBase')

from RhythmBase.Global.Components.Vector import *
from RhythmBase.Global.Settings import *
from RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor.Components import *
from RhythmBase.RhythmDoctor.Events import *

settings = LevelReadOrWriteSettings()
settings.UnreadableEventsHandling = UnreadableEventHandling.Store
rdlevel = RDLevel.Default

for row in rdlevel.Rows:
    move_row = MoveRow()
    move_row.Beat = RDBeat(3)
    move_row.Position = RDPointE(10,20)

rdlevel.SaveToFile('111.rdlevel')
```

This flexibility enables RhythmBase to integrate into various toolchains and workflows, regardless of your preferred programming language or development environment.
